### Full-bleed dividers

Full-bleed dividers separate content into sections and span the entire length of a layout.

#### Full-bleed dividers example

* [Class definition](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/material/Divider-class.html)
* [GitHub source](https://github.com/flutter/flutter/blob/master/packages/flutter/lib/src/material/divider.dart)
* [Demo site](demo site here)

The following example shows a list with full-bleed dividers:

_**Note to developers: Add code and a screenshot that shows the following:**_
* A list of text items, labeled "Item 1", "Item 2"..."Item n"
* Each item is separated by a full-bleed divider

### Inset dividers

Inset dividers separate related content, anchored by elements that align with the app bar title.

* [Demo site](demo site here)

The following example shows two lists separated by an inset divider and a subheader

_**Note to developers: Add code and a screenshot that shows the following:**_
* Two lists text lists divided by an inset divider
* List A has 3 items: "A1," "A2," "A3"

_**Note to developers: show a list of items separated from a total by a middle divider**_
* A list of text items, labeled "Item 1", "Item 2"..."Item n"
* Each item in the list has a price: "Item 1" -\> "$1", "Item 2" -\> "$2" ... "Item n" -\> "$n"
* Below the middle divider is the total
